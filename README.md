# TMED77
This reposite contains the sequences and structure models of all 39 proteins in a clique from the sequence similarity network (SSN). 

The models were constrated using either I-TASSER (5.1) or AlphaFold2.

A one-to-one comparison of the I-TASSER and AlphaFold2 models find a RMSD of ca. 2.8 (2.49 for TMED77).
